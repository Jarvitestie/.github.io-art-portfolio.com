<p> <em> <strong> I am a visual artist from Port Talbot. I have started making art since college with Manga Art.<br> This began when was studying IT; during the time, I was learning Computer Programming.<br> During the time, I was lossing interest with Computer Programming. This is because there was no direction with the lessons provided. <br> Instead, I began moving towards making Art that kicked started my career as a visual artist. </strong> </em> </p>
